# PoorlyDrawnRobotsInSpace

A Win32 Lode Runner-type game I made when I was 17

Back in high school, I took a computer science class.  Instead of doing the "assignments," I 
amused myself by making games.  Recently discovered on a very old hard drive, I think this one was my final project.

To compile, you need an old version of DirectX (it requires DirectDraw) and Visual Studio 6.  Put the .exe in the 
same folder as the assets and you're good to go.

You can download a pre-built verison here:

For more information about the game and some screenshots, check out this blog post: http://www.mrericsir.com/blog/personal/poorly-drawn-robots-in-space/
